            <p>My name is Jamleck and am 21 years of age,i come from a family of two and am the second born in the family of Mr/Mrs.Wanjohi.I 
                finished my high school in 2014 and later joined Jomo Kenyatta University and pursued Information and Technology which am still pursuing.
                so far i have not worked in any organization or company to gage my skills but i hope so in future.I decided to pursue programming
